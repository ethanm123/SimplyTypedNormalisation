# Proof of the property of strong normalisation on simply typed lambda terms
An implementation of the proof by R.O Gandy that simply typed lambda terms are strongly normalising. 
All functions are written by me except where otherwise specified. 
This isn't a complete proof as there is no proof here that the bound always reduces, however it can be seen that the bound does reduce by using the example terms.
