# Proof of the property of strong normalisation on simply typed lambda terms
Assignment designed by Dr. Willem Heijltjes (http://willem.heijltj.es/)
All functions are written by me except where otherwise specified. Where the function is not written by me, it is written by Dr. Willem Heijltjes.
An implementation of the proof by R.O Gandy that simply typed lambda terms are strongly normalising. 
This isn't a complete proof as there is no proof here that the bound always reduces, however it can be seen that the bound does reduce by using the example terms.
